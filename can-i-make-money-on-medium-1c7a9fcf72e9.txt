Absolutely! Medium.com is one of the few blogging platforms on the internet where you can quickly sign up, post your great content, and get paid after a month.

In my own opinion, after trying over 5 different writing sites in a few years, Medium is the best blogging platform of them all.

You don’t need a niche, you don’t need to do affiliate marketing (although you can if you want to) and you don’t need pesky ads to earn money.

When I first joined Medium back in June of 2019, I did so out of the advice of a few friends as a hobby to pursue while I was traveling around Asia. I loved the platform and the idea that you could make a few bucks while doing something you enjoy!

I wrote a couple of articles in the content management system dashboard and drew a few digital portraits as my first posts, made around $10 and didn’t look back for a while as life got in the way.

Since October 2019, I’ve been going at Medium like a burning bat out of a pest-control facility, and have had an amazing time on the platform!
